Hope Gang Contests, created by Leo Herzog (Agent L Productions), is a website to help organize and collect photoshop contests from The Hope Gang (https://facebook.com/groups/thehopegang).

It uses Facebook Login (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/) to show the current and past photo galleries from the group.

hopegangcontests.com will NEVER record or store your Facebook login credentials. The site may leave a cookie on your computer with your Facebook credentials so that the photo galleries from the group are visible. However, the website will never store a database of users.

The site may also use analytics platforms such as Google Analytics to anonymously monitor web traffic.

We promise to always value your privacy, and will only use Facebook Login to display relevant data. Nothing else.
